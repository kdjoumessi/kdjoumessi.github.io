# About me
I am a PhD student in the Department of Data Science at the [Hertie Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Brain Health](https://hertie.ai/data-science/research-groups) at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/) and an [IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/scholars) scholar since June 2021. I work on __Interpretable Machine Learning for Safe Medical Diagnostics__ and am keenly interested in research that can safely and securely benefit patient health or user well-being.
