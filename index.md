# About me
I am a PhD student in the Department of Data Science at the [Hertie Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Brain Health](https://hertie.ai/data-science/team/members/kerol-djoumessi) at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/) and an [IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/scholars) scholar since June 2021. I work on __Interpretable Machine Learning for Safe Medical Diagnostics__ and am keenly interested in research that can safely and securely benefit patient health or user well-being.
 
## Bio
I hold an undergraduate degree in Computer Mathematics (BSc) and Computer Science (MSc) from the University of Dschang, Cameroon. After another Master's (MSc) in Applied mathematics at the [African Institute for Mathematical Science (AIMS)](https://aims.ac.za/) in South Africa, I joined the [International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS)](https://imprs.is.mpg.de) where I am doing my PhD in __Machine Learning for Medical Image Analysis__ under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Philipp Berens](https://hertie.ai/data-science).

## Research interests
My research focuses on __interpretable/explainable deep learning models for clinical diagnosis__, particularly inherently interpretable models for medical image analysis with applications in ophthalmology. In addition to interpretability, I am also interested in __Computer Vision, Vision Language Models (VLMs), clinical ethics, resource-efficient deep learning models, and the deployment of deep learning models__.
